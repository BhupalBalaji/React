Q1.  link: it is used to create links to different routes and implement navigation around the application. It works like HTML anchor tag.
     Route: it is the conditionally shown component that renders some UI when its path matches the current URL
     BrowserRouter: BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API to keep UI in sync with the URL. It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components
     withRouter: it's a higher order component that will pass closest route's match , current location , and history props to the wrapped component whenever it renders and it connects component to the router. Not all components, especially the shared components, will have the access to such router's props

Q2. import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'

const Button = () => (
  <Route render={({ history}) => (
    <button
      type='button'
      onClick={() => { history.push('/new-location') }}
    >
      Click Me!
    </button>
  )} />
)

Q3. export: it export the object in the current file to make this object usable in another file.
    ex: //name.js file
  const person = {
    name:'Kedar'
}

export default person;



//info.js

export const age = 23;


   import: 2 ways=> Importing from default exports => importing anything from that file will provide us with a object.
                   ex: importing from name.js
                        import person from './name.js'


                   Importing from named exports => we use {} to precisely target specific things from that file and these are called named exports, as we import them by their name.
                   ex: import {age} from './info.js'
